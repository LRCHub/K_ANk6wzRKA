Take action!
When your love is gone and run away
Take action!
When you want to learn the way to play
Don't be afraid to walk out everyday
Your love is still the same

Your mind is fond of everything and all it sees
You're picking up a life with all it's memories
Don't be afraid
Never change your ways and looks
Don't be afraid
Your life is like a history book

Never mind
Never mind
They'll always be adult for you to stay behind
Never fear
Never fear
You're running but you're standing still
And I'm still here

Your mind is fond of everything and all it sees
You're picking up a life with all it's memories
Don't be afraid
Never change your ways and looks
Don't be afraid
Your life is like a history book

Never mind
Never mind
They'll always be adult for you to stay behind
Never fear
Never fear
You're running but you're standing still
And I'm still here

Your mind is fond of everything and all it sees
You're picking up a life with all it's memories
Don't be afraid
Never change your ways and looks
Don't be afraid
Your life is like a history book

Take action!
When your love is gone and run away
Take action!
When you want to learn the way to play.
