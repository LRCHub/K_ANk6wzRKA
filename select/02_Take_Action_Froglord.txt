Populations now are ever falling down,
At the hand of man, the hands that takes the land.

From the original and the traditional
Destroy the habitat, there's no going back.

But unless action is taken now
To digress from this oath we've lead
Down a road, destruction untold
Save the frogs, and so save the world

Looking down the barrels end, decisions must be made
Keep moving in this direction, no fates set in clay.

It's not too late to change the damage that's been made,
It can be undone; a new age has begun.
